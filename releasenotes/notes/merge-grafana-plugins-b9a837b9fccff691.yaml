    New logic for installing grafana plugins. When building you can pass a
    variable ``grafana_plugins_append`` that contains a list of plugins you
    want to install. This will be appended to the default list of plugins. The
    existing method of overwriting the ``grafana_plugins_install`` block still
    works.
