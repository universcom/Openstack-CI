    Fixes a hypothetical security issue related to privilege escalation via
    rootwrap/privsep. A potential vulnerable service could previously allow
    writes to its rootwrap/privsep config and thus allow for more commands
    to be run with root privileges via rootwrap/privsep. For a successful
    attack, this would also require the service to allow to run arbitrary
    commands via rootwrap/privsep. Thus far, no such vulnerabilities have
    been reported and thus this fix is simply strengthening the container
    images against such an issue in the future.
