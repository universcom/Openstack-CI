    Fixes CVE-2022-38060, a sudo privilege escalation vulnerability.

    To fix CVE-2022-38060, support for KOLLA_CONFIG and KOLLA_CONFIG_FILE
    environment variables in kolla-built containers has been dropped.
    Now, only the single trusted path of
    ``/var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json`` will be utilised for loading
    container config.
    We believe this is a reasonable tradeoff as these environment variables
    were not used by any known downstream and potential users in the wild
    can easily adapt as this does not limit the functionality per se, only
    making it stricter as to where the config can come from.
