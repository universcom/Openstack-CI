    The ``apt-get update`` command by default didn't fail on erroneous source
    repositories, it show the warning 'W: Some index files failed to download.
    They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.' and continue to work.
    This causes some containers (eg. rabbitmq, kolla-toolbox) successfully
    built, but makes them inconsistent because the official Ubuntu repository
    contains packages with the same names. Now we use ``apt-get -eany update``
    command to stop building with an error in such cases.
