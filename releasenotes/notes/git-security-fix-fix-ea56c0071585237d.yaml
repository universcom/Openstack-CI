    Fixes an issue building images that use a source with a ``type`` of
    ``git``, when using a git that includes the fix for `CVE-2022-24765
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24765>`__ (2.35.2
    or later). By default, this includes the ``gnocchi-base`` image, but may
    include other images with a non-default configuration.  `LP#837710
